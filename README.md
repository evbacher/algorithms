# algorithms
This is a repository where I am saving my programs exploring various algorithms, starting with sorting algorithms.

## Sorting algorithms

### Bubble sort

* [bubbleSort.go](https://github.com/evbacher/algorithms/blob/main/sorting/bubbleSort.go)
  
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort for a general overview. My first commit of the bubble sort code is not optimized at all, but I should try that out.

### Quicksort

* [quicksort.go](https://github.com/evbacher/algorithms/blob/main/sorting/quicksort.go)

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort and Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley for information about this algorithm.

### Counting sort

* [countingSort.go](https://github.com/evbacher/algorithms/blob/main/sorting/countingSort.go)

A distribution sort that can be faster than quicksort for large collections of integers with a relatively small range of values (say 1000).

# Search algorithms

### Linear search

* [linearSearch.go](https://github.com/evbacher/algorithms/blob/main/search/linearSearch.go)

When you have an unsorted array, linear search (a brute force check of every element) may be the only option.
